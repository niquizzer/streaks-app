App Name: Streaks
- This app will be a simple tool that takes Jerry Seinfield's idea of 
"don't break the chain" and makes it into a functional app. The idea is 
you can create an account, and your dashboard will hold all of your "chains".
These chains are the different habits you want to track, and your goal is to
simply not break the chain.

- CRUD ops implemented
